# Checkers

The program is a classic checkers game with three modes of play:

**- single-player against a computer opponent**

**- two-player game on one computer**

**- two-player game over a socket-based server**

# Compile

To turn on the program you should start main class in any IDE that supports GUI.
The program was writing in the Intellij IDE so I recommend it to use while trying the program.
